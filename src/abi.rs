//! The WebAssembly interface: plain exports rather than wasm-bindgen.
//!
//! Exported functions take and return offsets into this module's own memory,
//! so the build needs nothing but cargo and a wasm32 target -- no bindgen CLI
//! whose version has to match the crate's -- and the loader on the other side
//! is a few lines of JavaScript. See editor.js in the shell.
//!
//! One convention: the caller allocates, writes UTF-8 into this module's
//! memory, calls `compile` or `title_of`, and reads the result back out of it.
//! Both return the length; `output_ptr` says where it starts and `ok` whether
//! there is a document.
//!
//! A compile leaves a second result beside the first: `diagnostics()` is the
//! length of the JSON list of what the compiler had to say and
//! `diagnostics_ptr()` where it starts. Two results rather than one envelope,
//! because the page is a megabyte and the list is a hundred bytes, and
//! wrapping the first in JSON to carry the second would be an encode and a
//! decode of the wrong thing on every keystroke.
//!
//! Which renderer `compile` is depends on which feature this module was built
//! with, so markdown.wasm and typst.wasm share a loader and differ only in
//! what they do with a source.
