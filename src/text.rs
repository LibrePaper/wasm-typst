//! The word diff, vendored from the Komodoc application repository.
//!
//! Upstream is `crates/text/src/lib.rs` in LibrePaper/komodoc, whose `diff` is
//! what the native side computes. The editor's history panel asks this module
//! for the same diff over the same tokens, so the two must agree: this file is
//! a verbatim copy, and changes belong upstream first. `merge` comes along
//! unused rather than being carved out, so that a diff against upstream is
//! empty and drift is visible at a glance.

//! The word diff, and the three-way merge that `komodoc sync` needs when a
//! text editor saves a buffer that was read before the session moved on.
//!
//! A token here is either a maximal run of whitespace or a maximal run of
//! non-whitespace, and the two alternate. A whitespace run is a token of its
//! own so that a doubled space or an added trailing newline is one small edit
//! rather than a rewrite of the words either side of it; punctuation carries
//! along with the word it is attached to, because an author who changes
//! `interval.` to `interval,` changed one thing. The unit is the word and
//! never the line: the editable examples are one line per paragraph, so a
//! merge by line would call any two edits to the same paragraph a conflict,
//! which is most of the conflicts this command would ever see.
//!
//! Every position out of this module -- in `Edit` and in `Conflict` alike --
//! is a UTF-16 code unit offset, because that is what the document counts in
//! (`session::replace_text` does the same arithmetic) and what a JavaScript
//! string counts in. A caller holding a `yrs::Text` or a browser string can
//! use these numbers without converting anything.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about Yrs, Tokio, the store or the room. It is a pure
//! function over three strings, in a crate of its own so that the binary and
//! the engine -- which exports it to the browser for the timeline's per-file
//! diff -- can both reach it.
